# Uniandes gamejam2017, survivor of the wasteland
Hello, I made this game some months ago in the first game jam I've ever been. I was alone and I basically made all of this in 24 hours on the campus of my university.

I need to say thanks to the two guys that helped me with all the sounds you can find here,
* Music:
  * Diego Alejandro Tovar
* SFX:
  * Jos√© David Romero
These two did an amazing work while I was runing making this game. I loved doing it and I'll be practicing more with unity.
  
# How to play it
there are two ways you can use to play the game:
1. The newest build of the game you can find it in the `builds` folder. In there a `.zip` folder has the executable and everthing you need.
2. The original game I uploaded for the gamejam it's in a `.zip` folder [here!](https://gamejolt.com/games/Surivor/282621)
